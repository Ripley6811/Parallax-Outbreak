Stars and\r\nnebulae flow across the background as the player paddle moves.\r\n\r\nThe nebulae background\r\n(with dark spots to make the stars twinkle) was made in Adobe Photoshop CC on a 5x15 inch\r\ncanvas (128 ppi) using the \"Scattered Flowers Mums\" brush in the \"Special Effect\r\nBrushes\" set. Stars and other assets were made programmatically with LibGDX's ShapeRenderer\r\nor Pixmap classes.\r\n\r\nAudio was created with [CheeseCutter SID Music Editor 2.7](http://theyamo.kapsi.fi/ccutter/about.html)\r\nand edited with [Audacity 2.1.1](http://audacityteam.org/).\r\n\r\n##Gameplay\r\n\r\nThere are three modes of game-play; \"Easy\", \"Hard\" and \"Insane!\". Ball max speed\r\nincreases with each difficulty level and the number of hits required before balls double\r\nalso increases with difficulty. \"Insane!\" also has *blocks regenerating* every few seconds.\r\n\r\n**Desktop**: Use arrow keys to move the paddle and \"UP\" to launch the ball.\r\n\r\n**Android**: Touch the screen to launch the ball and angle the device downward\r\nin the direction you want the paddle to move.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Ball-Split\" counter reaches zero, all balls on screen will split in two,\r\nup to a maximum of 10 balls in play.\r\n\r\n2 points for every block hit and negative 1 point for each paddle hit.\r\n\r\nWhen the game ends, tap or click on screen to return to the options menu.\r\n\r\n*Tip:* For maximum damage, try to get a ball in a good position above a set of\r\nblocks before a ball-split event.\r\n\r\n*Tip:* No need to chase balls, wait for them to wrap around and enter the screen\r\nfrom the other side.\r\n\r\n##References\r\n\r\n- Udacity's *2D Game Development with LibGDX* course - **www.udacity.com**\r\n- How to use logging - **Learning LibGDX Game Development** Chapters 2-3.\r\n- How to use Pixmap - **Learning LibGDX Game Development** Ch. 3, Pg. 99.\r\n- LibGDX Class Reference - **libgdx.badlogicgames.com**\r\n- [How to display fonts - **www.gamefromscratch.com**](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2013/09/26/LibGDX-Tutorial-2-Hello-World.aspx)\r\n- [How to scale BitmapFont - **stackoverflow.com**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29814995/java-libgdx-bitmapfont-setscale-method-not-working)\r\n- [How to compare strings in Java - **stackoverflow.com**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java)\r\n- [How to use Android back button - **stackoverflow.com**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7223723/in-libgdx-how-do-i-get-input-from-the-back-button)\r\n- [How to add sound effects - **github.com**](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Sound-effects)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
